**Day zero thought for project:**

From Dalal Street to digital portfolios - India’s financial market is not just numbers—it’s the heartbeat of dreams, growth, and progress. In the World of stock market, most of investors who invest in stock market struggles with many problems like gathering and understanding the stock data, management and manipulation of investments they hold and analyzing the scattered information. Many investors are overwhelmed by complex data and are unable to derive meaningful conclusions, leading to confusion and suboptimal decision-making. Also, the absence of intuitive tools creates a gap in aligning investment strategies with financial goals. This lack of clarity and integration results in missed opportunities, and reduced confidence in managing personal investments.

**Formalization of the Solution:**

To solve these challenges, we come up with an idea to build a platform that brings all investment details together in one place. We want to build a system which helps investors track their portfolios in a simple and organized way. Which also provides clear insights, easy-to-read dashboards, and tools to analyze performance. We want to build platform designed to be secure, easy to use, and focused on helping investors save time, reduce confusion, and make better financial decisions.
